# Robofriends: A random robot generator using public url api 

To get start, copy the https link under code tab in github. Open a directory/folder and run:

### `git clone https://github.com/zadolphe/robofriends.git`
### `npm start`
Note: you might need to run npm install prior to npm start

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes (if you'd like).\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Optional: run build for optimized build for production.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed! And is the build folder you see made once you run this.

See the section from the React documentation about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
